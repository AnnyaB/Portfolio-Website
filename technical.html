    <h2>Technical Interests</h2>

    <section id="vedic-cosmology">
        <h3>Vedic Cosmology</h3>
        <img src="VEDIC-COSMOLOGY.jpg" alt="Image representing Vedic Cosmology (Sanskrit label)" loading="lazy">
        <p>I am inspired by Vedic Cosmology through the Srimad Bhagavatam, originally written in Sanskrit by Vyasa Dev and translated into English by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. Over the past 1 year and 8 months, I have delved into its profound insights, which blend ancient wisdom with scientific understanding and teaches what the human form of life is meant for. Apart from my university studies, I actively engage quite amount of time studying about matter and antimatter. Primarily focusing on Achintya Bheda Abheda philopsophy. Before getting initiated herein, I had an introductory background in space science studies since grade 6, driven by my interest in space and galaxies, along with learning modern physics for over seven years.</p>

    <section id="cosmic-motions">
        <h3>Cosmic Motions</h3>
        <img src="COSMIC-MOTIONS.jpg" alt="Image representing Cosmic Motions" loading="lazy">
        <p>Understanding the forces and movements that govern the universe fascinates me. My exploration of cosmic motions fuels my ambition to contribute to space science and gain insights into astrophysics research. My recent research work includes the 14 planetary systems and dimensional overview of planets above and below bhurloka (earth). </p>

    <section id="ideas-to-facts">
        <h3>Building Ideas into Facts</h3>
        <img src="IDEAS-TO-REALITY.jpg" alt="Image representing turning ideas into facts" loading="lazy">
        <p>Transforming conceptual ideas into validated realities is a passion of mine. This involves rigorous experimentation, analysis, and iterative learning to convert theoretical concepts into actionable solutions.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="game-development">
        <h3>Developing Skill-Boosting Games</h3>
        <img src="GAME-DEVELOPMENT.jpg" alt="Image representing Game Development" loading="lazy">
        <p>Game development is a creative outlet where I merge art, storytelling, and programming to design immersive user experiences. I particularly enjoy creating interactive games that foster learning and skill-building.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="swarm-intelligence">
        <h3>Swarm Intelligence</h3>
        <img src="SWARM-INTELLIGENCE.jpg" alt="Image representing Swarm Intelligence" loading="lazy">
        <p>Swarm Intelligence (effective at solving complex robotic problems) models the collective behavior of self-organized systems, like how ants or birds coordinate. I see its potential in enabling coordinated robot and drone fleets for space exploration and environmental monitoring, revolutionizing how we gather data and uncover cosmic secrets.</p>

    <section id="ai-in-fashion">
        <h3>Artificial Intelligence in Fashion</h3>
        <img src="AI-IN-FASHION.jpg" alt="Image representing Artificial Intelligence in Fashion" loading="lazy">
        <p>I am passionate about leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to transform the fashion industry, from personalized recommendations and trend forecasting to fostering sustainable practices. This intersection of AI and fashion opens up exciting possibilities for innovation. Me and my friends work for luxury fashion brands. </p>
    </section>

    <section id="robotics-automation">
        <h3>Robotics and Automation</h3>
        <img src="ROBOTICS-AUTOMATION.jpg" alt="Image representing Robotics and Automation" loading="lazy">
        <p>I envision robotics playing a pivotal (vital) role in cosmology, enabling us to explore distant planets and analyze cosmic phenomena. By merging robotics with space science, we can push the boundaries of human knowledge and make groundbreaking discoveries.</p>
